# odin_rock_paper_scissors

This project is part of The Odin Project – Foundations curriculum. The goal of this project is to build a simple Rock Paper Scissors game that runs entirely in the browser console using JavaScript.

By completing this project, I have demonstrated the ability to:

- Write clean and readable JavaScript code
- Use functions to organize logic and avoid repetition
- Implement basic control flow using conditionals and loops
- Work with user input and computer-generated values
- Manage game state across multiple rounds
